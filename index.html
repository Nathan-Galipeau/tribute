    <h2><b>Personality</b></h2>
      <p>Killua has a very strange mix of personalities. He has the mind of an adult, but the attitude of a child. To most people, Killua appears very rude and cold. To close friends, Killua can appear kind and fun. As I said in the beginning, Killua can also be violent and bloodthirsty. He can also act, well, like a 12-year-old. That’s because he is one, and he has the childish attitude most of the time, especially around his friends. However, Killua is also very mature both mentally and emotionally. Another important trait is his overwhelming loyalty toward his friends. Killua is willing to do anything for his friends, even risking his own life. Of course, the point of this blog is to analyze Killua’s character bit by bit. So, let’s start with the very beginning: his childhood. Killua has a very rough childhood because he was a member of the Zoldyck Family. For this, I totally forgive him for being rude. In our current society, what that family did to him for training would definitely be child abuse. Living in a corrupted household, it’s only natural Killua would be rude and skeptical at first glance. Even if his rudeness appears as a simple part of his character, when you think about it this trait could mean a lot to others suffering from parental abuse. Those who live in a corrupted family come out corrupted, it’s only natural. However, this rude nature of Killua soon changed after he tried out the hunter exam. Why? Killua met Gon at the hunter exam. This meeting started one of the best friendships in anime history. Gon is a very friendly, kind, and supportive type of person. Almost the opposite of Killua. Opposites in friendships usually seems bad, however in this case it was good. Both Gon and Killua became so much different because they met eachother. Meeting eachother both effected their minds and even their lives. However, we’ll save this part for later. I do want to discuss how Gon affect Killua’s personality, because there’s a major difference. Due to a horrible childhood, Killua was quite rude. After meeting Gon, Killua wasn’t rude at all. In fact, he became extremely kind and grateful. Thanks because Gon showed him what friendship really is, and that there is reason to continue living life. After Gon showed Killua this, his personality changed to somewhat that of an angel. Killua swore to do anything for his friends, and he would always stay with them, no matter what. During the Chimera ant arc, Gon fell into an insane state. He went crazy due to Pitou murdering Kite, Who Gon looked up to. This made Killua distress, and even have multiple mental breakdowns. The mental state of Killua is another thing I want to talk about. Killua’s very smart, which is good but it also means he could easily realize the bad things in life.</p>

    <h2><b>Appearance</b></h2>
    <p>Killua has spiky silver hair, very pale skin, and blue eyes. His eyes change shape depending on the mood that he's in, narrowing and sharpening when he goes into assassination mode. Killua is fairly lean at the start of the series, due to constant physical conditioning and torture training he received when he was young. As time passes, he becomes more muscular and toned. In the Nippon Animation anime adaptation, Killua's eye color is changed to green during the OVAs. He is also often seen holding a green skateboard (turned yellow in the 2011 series). Killua typically wears baggy clothing, with his usual attire consisting of long-sleeved and dark-colored shirts. Most of his clothes have a turtleneck. Killua wears long, baggy shorts in the manga and Madhouse animated adaptation, but Nippon Animation's character design shortened them to reach above his knees. Killua also wears purple boots, recolored brown and black in the Nippon Animation adaptation. As a child, Killua's hair is longer, almost cascading to his shoulders. He wore a hoodie with his trademark blue coloring, grey pants, and shoes.</p>

    <h2><b>Abilities</b></h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
      <li>Superhuman Physicality: Due to his extensive training from birth to become an assassin, Killua has trained his physical abilities to superhuman levels.</li>
    <li>Resistant to Electricity and Poison: Through his training, Killua has become very resistant to electricity and toxins. He can withstand high levels of voltage with ease, and can drink five cans of laxatives without any side effects.</li>
    <li>Muscle Control: During his assassin training, Killua was taught how to manipulate his muscles and joints. He can effortlessly dislodge his joints to escape being bound, before fixing them just as easily. He can also adjust the anatomy of his hand to transform his fingernails into razor-sharp claws, capable of slicing through human limbs with ease.</li>
    <li>Assassin Techniques: During his assassin training, Killua learned many different assassination abilities.
        <ul>
          <li>The Snake Awakens: Killua whips his arms around with incredible speed to slice through anything that touches them.</li>
          <li>Shadow Step: Killua can walk and run around without making a sound.</li>
          <li>Rhythm Echo: Through a varying cadence of steps, Killua can create afterimages of himself to confuse his enemy.
      </ul></li>
    <li>Nen: Nen is the ability to use the life energy, or aura, of the user and manipulate it. Killua's Nen type is Transmuter, meaning he specializes in making his aura mimic the properties of something else. While he can't produce as much aura as Gon, Killua has much greater control over his.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ten: By forming a shroud of aura around the user's body, they can use it as a basic defense against Nen attacks, though it doesn't protect against physical attacks. Ten also slows down the user's aging process and keep their body from breaking down over time.</li>
         <li>Zetsu: Keeps the user's aura from leaking out of their body, making them harder to sense and relieving fatigue, at the cost of leaving them defenseless against Nen attacks.</li>
        <li>Ren: Expands the size and intensity of the user's aura to boost their strength and durability.</li>
        <li>Gyo: Focuses aura into a single part of the body to increase its strength, at the cost of leaving the rest of the body more vulnerable. Using Gyo on the eyes allows the user to see someone else's aura, or other hidden objects.</li>
        <li>In: An advanced form of Zetsu that hides the user's aura without forcing them to shut it off, making it perfect for sneak attacks.</li>
        <li>En: Expands the user's aura in a spherical radius around them, letting them sense the shape and movement of anything that enters it.</li>
        <li>Shu: Extends the user's aura onto an object that they're holding, enhancing its strength.</li>
        <li>Ko: Concentrates all of the user's aura into one part of their body, making it incredibly powerful, at the cost of the rest of the body being completely defenseless.</li>
        <li>Ken: A combination of Ten and Ren, using Ren to enhance the user's aura before enveloping themselves with it, providing greater defense than Ten.</li>
        <li>Ryu: The real-time use of Gyo, shifting the concentration of aura between two body parts in quick succession.</li>
    <li>Electricity Manipulation: Killua's Hatsu, the special way he uses Nen, is the power to transform his Aura into electrical currents and manipulate it. He does this by absorbing electricity from an outside source.</li>
        <li>Thunder Palm: After channeling electricity into his hands, Killua touches the target to give them a powerful shock.</li>
        <li>Thunderbolt: Fires a bolt of lightning from Killua's hand, usually from the air. While it doesn't inflict much physical damage, it is very painful and can stun the target.</li></ul></ul></p>
